#  Central Bank Landing Page

I made a landing page example using a physical credit card and the presentation as a product design example.

The objective was working with [Spline](https://spline.design/) a 3D online modeler and the library [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) where i was able to manage the model animation, rotation, position and triggers on scroll.
